# Multi EXE

## Checklist

### MVP

- Add Files: The user enters file paths manually or through a command-line prompt.
- View Files: Display the current list of files.
- Remove Files: Allow the user to remove specific files by their index.
- Open Files: Use std::system or a similar command to execute files.

### Plans
- File Explorer Add Files
- Use a file extention that opens program, then opens exes, then closes (does not need GUI).
- Enable creation of Multi EXE files, editing as well.
- Create README Documentation
- Create requirements.txt
- WxWidgets GUI
- GUI Styling
